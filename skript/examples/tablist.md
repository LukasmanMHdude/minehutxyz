# Example: Tablist

## OVERVIEW

This tutorial will show you how to create a customised tablist *(TAB key)* on your server using Skript.

{% hint style="info" %} Skript addon skRayFall is required! {% endhint %}

## CODE

```
on join:
  set tab header to "" and footer to "" for player
```

## EXPLAINED

Simple add in text between the `""`'s and you're all set. The tab header and footer will only be set when the player joins, so if you're looking to update it, it's better to use a function *(below)*.

## FUNCTION

```
function tab(header: text, footer: text, P: player):
  set tab header to "%{_header}%" and footer to "%{_footer}%" for {_P}
```
