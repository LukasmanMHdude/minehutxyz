# DOWNLOADING YOUR SERVER

## Downloading a World

Join your server, find your specific world using `/worlds`, then do `/dl world <world name>`. This may take a second but will create a download link to **https://dl.minehut.com/**.

## Downloading a Schematic

You can also download a build schematic, which allows you to select a specific build and save it. 

### Downloading it

Do `/dl schem <name>`. You can find the list of schematics using `/schem list`.
