# Server Operator

## OVERVIEW

Being a server operator allows you to run most of the general commands the server has, including the dangerous ones.
**Only give operator to people you trust** as they **ban/kick** players (read what that means [here](faq/ingame/moderation.md). They can also give themselves **items, bypass whitelist, etc.** "Deoping" a user removes these permissions. Sometimes, your friends will request op "because they can't play", this is sometimes due to Minehut's built-in spawn radius. I recommend turning this to `0` in your panel. 

## HOW TO OP YOURSELF

Type `/op (your username)` into the **Server Command** area of the panel. This will op you. If you are already a server operator, you can use the commands ingame as well.

## HOW TO OP A USER

```
JAVA: /op (username)
BEDROCK: /op *(username)
```

## HOW TO DEOP A USER

```
JAVA: /deop (username)
BEDROCK: /deop *(username)
```

## HOW TO GIVE PERMISSIONS

Many plugins you install may give errors like "You don't have permission to use this commsnd". For people you don't trust, you can use [luckperms](plugin/permission-plugins/lp)'s web editor to configure permissions. (Test it out [here](https://luckperms.net/editor/demo)!
