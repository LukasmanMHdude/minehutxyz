# Permissions

## PERMISSION MANAGERS

On Minehut, you have a choice of five permission managers: `Permissionsex, Luckperms, Groupmanager, Ultimateperms, Zpermissions.`

{% hint style="warning" %}
`You only need to install 1 out of 5 permission managers.`
{% endhint %}

## HOW TO USE EACH PERMISSION MANAGER

{% hint style="info" %}
Each permission manager has lots more commands than shown below, visit each permission manager's tutorial page. I recommend choosing between lp and pex as those are the most used/stable.
{% endhint %}

```text
LuckPerms:
/lp user/group <player-name/group> permission set <perm node> 

Luckperms also has an amazing web editor, which you can get to using /lp editor. I HIGHLY recommend it for new players because of this feature.

Permissionsex:
/pex [user/group] <player-name/group> add <perm node>

According to some players, pex is more stable and easier to use than lp (excluding the web editor).

Group Manager:
/[manuaddp/mangaddp] <player-name/group> <perm node>

Zpermissions:
/permissions [user/group] <player-name/group> set <perm node> true

UltimatePerms:
/perms [user/group] <player-name/group> add <perm node>
```
