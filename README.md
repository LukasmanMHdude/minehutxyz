## OUR AIM

We aim to provide high-quality tutorials, provide answers to top questions, and help in any way we can. Our site is [community driven](contribute.md), and we will continue to improve it into the future. We are constantly working with our vast staff team to create much high quality, easy to use, and helpful tutorials ðŸ™‚. We need writers/staff to help us manage, so learn how to apply [here](). 

## THE 123'S OF MINEHUT

With many talented and old users of minehut, we know a thing or 2 about how to make a website. Starting with our [full tutorial on making a minehut account and setting up your first servers](), and our upcoming (and partially finished) [guide on making a successful server on minehut](https://minehut.xyz/faq/making-a-server). We have resources on how to make your server stand out.

## EVERY QUESTION ANSWERED. EVER.

With many staff being active on minehut's discord, as well as some even being official support members, we've spent many hours ensuring we have an answer to every question.
