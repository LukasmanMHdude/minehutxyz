# About

## Info

This section contains documentation for Minehut's API. The base URL for Minehut's API is `api.minehut.com`
There will be 6 main sections:
`server` -> Allows you to manage and view servers.
`file` -> Allows you to manage files for a server.
`admin` -> Endpoints for Minehut admins.
`misc` -> Other endpoints that don't really fit in any categories.

Note about the admin endpoints: We're unsure how admin endpoints were documented, so we'll only be able to put on what's currently documented. We  cannot guarantee this is up to date.
